# Identity_Resolution
### General Introduction
In the modern world, social networks are a set of websites, applications and other platforms that allow us to share content, create content and participate in social networks, possibly with millions of other users. This is a modern phenomenon that has an impact on a global scale.
Today, social media networks (SMNs) offer innovative services that facilitate access to news, campaigns, art, talents, marketing opportunities, and personal connections.
For example, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ are examples of general social networks. Other social networks are for special purposes like Instagram , Pinterest , and Flickr, which are used for image sharing. Linkedin is also a special-purpose social network specializing in business communications.
Indeed, social networks are a rich source of unstructured digital data that is growing at a significant pace.
During registration, he/she shares the identity with a set of personal information attributes, lists friends/contacts, and then creates content for sharing with friends according to the purpose of use. In each connected social network, the user creates a personality and makes up its three main dimensions, namely: profile, content and network attributes.	

### Problem Statement
Given the huge number of users on the social network, it may be practically impossible for a particular business to target the relevant customers manually or may lead to inefficient use of marketing resources. An effective system is needed that directs attention to a specific “identity” of people - using the technique of identity resolution.
